# _Proj_ Web App

_Proj_ is a highly customisable and queryable project management tool aimed at small and medium-sized enterprise consultancies. The application was developed in completion of a BSc Computer Science at the University of Sunderland.

This repo hosts the project web app, built as a Progressive Web App upon Angular 2/4 with TypeScript. The web app user interface was built from scratch with SASS, leveraging a "kitchen sink" approach. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.9.

There is also a supporting RESTful API, the URL of which must be added to the project environment file. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Screenshots

The proceeding screenshots do not disclosure the entire functionality of the system, but rather provide snippets of key UI views.
